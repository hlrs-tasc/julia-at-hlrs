# Julia at HLRS
Information and tools for providing Julia on the compute systems at HLRS.


## Adding a new Julia version
First, clone this repository and create an environment variable that refers to
the cloned directory's path:
```shell
git clone git@github.com:hlrs-tasc/julia-at-hlrs.git
export JULIA_AT_HLRS="$(pwd)/julia-at-hlrs"
```
If you can not read from remote repositories you can make a network
[connection via SOCKS and https proxy](https://github.com/larryhou/connect-proxy/tree/master).
From now on, we will use `$JULIA_AT_HLRS` to refer to files and folders relative
to the root of this repository.

### Installing Julia
Make sure you have permissions to write in `/sw/...` and that you are using one of the
following login nodes:
```shell
hawk-login01.hww.hlrs.de # hawk
cl1fr1.hww.hlrs.de # vulcan
```

Go to the directory where Julia should be installed:
```shell
cd /sw/general/x86_64/development/julia
```
Then, run the Julia install script with the full semver version of Julia you want to
install. For example, for Julia 1.9.3, execute
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/install_julia.sh 1.9.3
```
This will download the precompiled Julia binaries for the Linux x86\_64
architecture into the current working directory, and unpack it into a local
directory named after the semver version, e.g., `1.9.3`. The downloaded tar file
can afterwards be deleted with
```shell
rm julia-*-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
```

### Installing the module files
Module file installation on the compute systems at HLRS is tricky, at least on
Hawk. Thus read these instructions carefully and re-check after each step that
everything happened as you intended.

#### Hawk
Go to the directory where the Julia module files should be installed:
```shell
cd /opt/hlrs/non-spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/mpt/2.26/gcc/10.2.0/julia # for MPT
cd /opt/hlrs/non-spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/openmpi/4.1.4/gcc/10.2.0/julia # for OpenMPI
```
Make sure the paths above are correct for `hlrs-software-stack/current`. To do so, print the
module paths:
```shell
echo $MODULEPATH
```

Then, run the module file install script with the MPI implementation (either
`mpt` or `openmpi`) and the full semver version of Julia you want to
install. For example, for MPT MPI and Julia 1.9.3, execute
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/install_modulefiles.sh mpt 1.9.3
```
This will copy the relevant module files for the different Julia modules to the
current working directory.
Make sure that the file permissions are (at least) `r` for each user.

Next, update the module defaults and aliases by running the `set_modulerc.sh`
script with the full semver version of Julia you want to install. For example,
for Julia 1.9.3, execute
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/set_modulerc.sh 1.9.3
```
Note that this will **overwrite** the `.modulerc.lua` file in your current
directory with something like
```lua
module_version("julia/1.9.3", "default")
module_version("julia/1.9.3-cuda", "cuda")
```

Finally, create symlinks from the modulefile install directory to the directory
that is actually part of the module path. To achieve this, go to the module path
directory:
```shell
cd /opt/hlrs/spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/linux-rocky8-x86_64/gcc/10.2.0/mpt/julia # for MPT
cd /opt/hlrs/spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/linux-rocky8-x86_64/openmpi/4.1.4-y7nxabv/gcc/10.2.0/julia # for OpenMPI
```
Then, call the `install_symlinks.sh` script with the path to the modulefile
install directory and the full semver version of Julia you want to install. For
example, for Julia 1.9.3, create the MPT symlinks by executing
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/install_symlinks.sh /opt/hlrs/non-spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/mpt/2.26/gcc/10.2.0/julia 1.9.3
```
and the OpenMPI symlinks by executing
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/install_symlinks.sh /opt/hlrs/non-spack/rev-009_2022-09-01/modulefiles/gcc/10.2.0/openmpi/julia julia 1.9.3
```

#### Vulcan and Training Cluster
Go to the directory where the Julia module files should be installed:
```shell
cd /opt/modulefiles/julia # on Vulcan
cd /opt/hlrs/non-spack/modulefiles # on the training cluster
```

Then, run the module file install script with the MPI implementation left empty
(just pass the empty string `""`) and the full semver version of Julia you want to
install. For example, for Julia 1.9.3, execute
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/install_modulefiles.sh "" 1.9.3
```
This will copy the relevant module files for the different Julia modules to the
current working directory.

Next, update the module defaults and aliases by running the `set_modulerc.sh`
script with the full semver version of Julia you want to install. For example,
for Julia 1.9.3, execute
```shell
$JULIA_AT_HLRS/bin/set_modulerc.sh 1.9.3
```
Note that this will **overwrite** the `.modulerc`/`.modulerc.lua` file in your current
directory with something like
```tcl
module-version "julia/1.9.3" default
```
or
```lua
module_version("julia/1.9.3", "default")
```

### Verifying the new Julia module
To make sure that everything works as expected, log out and back in again, and
execute
```shell
module avail julia
```
This should list the new module files among the existing ones. Finally, verify
that Julia is working as expected by executing
```shell
module load julia
julia -e 'using InteractiveUtils; versioninfo()'
```
which should produce output similar to
```
